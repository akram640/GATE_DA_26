# Introduction to Data and Databases

### **Data**
- Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures without any context.
- By itself, data is not very useful. To make it meaningful, it needs to be organized and given context.

---

### **Database**
- A **database** is an organized collection of related data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

---

### **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate databases.

---

### **Database Management System (DBMS)**
- A **DBMS** is software that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage data in a database.

---

### **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**
- An **RDBMS** is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables with rows and columns.
- Examples: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, etc.

### **Example: Student Database**

| **StudentID** | **Name**       | **Age** | **Gender** | **Department**   | **Year** | **GPA** |
|---------------|----------------|---------|------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| 101           | Ayaan Khan     | 20      | Male       | Computer Science | 2        | 8.2     |
| 102           | Meera Joshi    | 21      | Female     | Mechanical       | 3        | 7.5     |
| 103           | Rohan Singh    | 19      | Male       | Electronics      | 1        | 8.9     |
| 104           | Anjali Rao     | 22      | Female     | Computer Science | 4        | 9.1     |
| 105           | Faiz Ali       | 20      | Male       | Civil            | 2        | 7.0     |

- **StudentID** is a unique identifier for each student and cannot be duplicated.

### **Key Points**
- **Data** becomes meaningful when organized into a **database**.
- **DBMS** provides tools to manage and retrieve data efficiently.
- **RDBMS** uses tables to structure data, making it easier to query and analyze.
